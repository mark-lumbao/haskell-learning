# Haskell Learning

I am but a humble programmer who's trying to dip my toes into the ocean of Functional Programming.

## Reasons?

- Deeply understand the concept of immutability
- Master configuration syntax for XMonad and XMobar
- Ease my adaption of Elm for front-end web development
- Brag about knowing Haskell and Functional Programming :3
