-- Folding
--
-- A fold takes a binary function, a starting value (I like to call it the accumulator) and a list to fold up.
-- The binary function itself takes two parameters. The binary function is called with the accumulator and the first (or last) element and produces a new accumulator.
-- Then, the binary function is called again with the new accumulator and the now new first (or last) element, and so on.
-- Once we've walked over the whole list, only the accumulator remains, which is what we've reduced the list to.
sum' :: (Num a) => [a] -> a

-- Better format

sum'' = foldl (+) 0

-- The right fold, foldr works in a similar way to the left fold, only the accumulator eats up the values from the right.
-- Also, the left fold's binary function has the accumulator as the first parameter and the current value as the second one (so \acc x -> ...),
-- the right fold's binary function has the current value as the first parameter and the accumulator as the second one (so \x acc -> ...).
-- It kind of makes sense that the right fold has the accumulator on the right, because it folds from the right side.
